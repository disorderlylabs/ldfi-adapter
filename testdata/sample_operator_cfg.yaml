# handler for adapter mygrpcadapter
## the auth_key is the value which we want to see in the header
# The key in line 26 is the name to which we map the request header. We could have left it as is, but this is just to make the point.
# i.e. the mixer takes the value of the header and assigns it as a value of the key in the map which is passed to the adapter code
# that is why we look for the key "custom_token_header" in the map
# notice how the client is passing the x-ebay-ldfi header

# the first spec here is the handler
